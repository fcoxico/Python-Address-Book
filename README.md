## My process

### Built with

- Python 3

### What I learned

I did this project in my spare time to learn some object creation and manipulation in Python. It was a simple, but cool project because I learned how to create objects in Python, as you can see below. 

```python
    def __init__(self, first, last, age, phone_number):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.age = age
        self.phone_number = phone_number
```
